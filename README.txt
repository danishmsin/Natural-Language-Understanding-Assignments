For Task-1:
	1. Set kernel to python3
	2. Execute "Danish.py" for Task1
	3. To validate the model use SimLex-999 dataset by executing "temp.py"
	4. All the files generated from the step-2 are to be stored in the same file as "temp.py" and also in the "xyz" folder.
        5. Check the results in "output.txt"

For Task-2:
	1. Set kernel to python3
	2. Execute "Ques_Ans.py" for Task2
	3. Two functions "ques_ans" and "bias" are used to check top 10 most neighbouring elements.
	4. "ques_ans" is used for analogy task and "bias" are used for biasing in the word_embeddings task.



There's a small typo in the report.  (Section 6.2 page 3)
- Instead of the analogy task -- London : England :: Athens : ?
The results were shown of the task -- Athens : Greece :: London : ?

Sorry for informing late..
