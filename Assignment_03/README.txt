First generate grammar with the help of Assignment_03.py.
For that, write down the below line of code in the directory /home/e1-246-23/Assignment_03/:

python3 Assignment_03.py

There are two ways to run the model:

1. To generate the new model and test on it.
2. To use the existing model and test on it.

For 1st Method:

Write the following lines:

python3 Assignment_03_train.py
python3 Assignment_03_test.py "Sample test Sentence."

For 2nd Method:

Write the following line:

./run.sh "Sample test Sentence."


The output of the model is the parsed output of the sampled test sentence.
